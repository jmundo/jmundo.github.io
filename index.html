                <h2>About Me:</h2>

                <p>My name is Jordan Mundo and I am from Auburn Washington. I have lived in the same house my whole life, and as many times as I have traveled, Washington is still my favorite place. I am a proud student of the Informatics major at the University of Washington and currently I am on the Information Assurance and Cybersecurity track. I am looking forward to learning more about security and how networks and system can be secured. I am a self-taught programmer and my background consists mostly of mobile app and game development for Android and IOS. Aside from being a student, I am also a profesional real-estate photographer for Estate Imaging. Photography has been a long time hobby of mine, although, only recently did I get into real-estate. Most of my photography work consists of landscape and macro photography. Feel free to contact me about anything! </p>
